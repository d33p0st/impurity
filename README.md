# Overview

`modstore` brings about the speed python lacked while implementing complex `Data Structures`. `modstore` upgrades pre-existing `Data Structures` to the point you can laid back and use `pre-built` complex functions. While still keeping the base Structures, `modstore` introduces better and improves ones such as `BlockChain`, `DAG` and much more.

Leveraging `Rust`'s speed and safety, new `Data Structures` are lightning fast and gives you the comfortability of using them via `Python`.

## Features

`modstore` provides a ton of data structures to mess around with.

`Categories:`

- Rust

  - [BlockChain](/docs/BlockChain/blockchain.md): Using Rust's performance, create a tamper proof blockchain data structure of your required difficulty. Search through the blockchain and retrieve data in their original form as provided. See docs [here](/docs/BlockChain/blockchain.md).

  - [DAG](/docs/DAG/dag.md): Directed Acyclic Graphs is a graph with no cycles, used in certain blockchain variants like [IOTA](https://www.iota.org). Create and manipulate and store Network Like data in DAGs. See docs [here](/docs/DAG/dag.md).
